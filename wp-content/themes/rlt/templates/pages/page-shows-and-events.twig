                <p>The Civil War is over. Throughout the South, slaves are being freed and soldiers are returning home. In one home, the annual celebration of Passover is celebrated by a young Confederate officer, who has been severely wounded, and two former slaves. However, the pain of enslavement will not be soothed by this tradition. Deeply buried secrets from the past refuse to be hidden forever, as the play comes to its thrilling conclusion.</p>
